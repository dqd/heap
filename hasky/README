Hasky, the Haskell interpreter

This is just a base for evaluation that handles parsing and type-checking.
It was described in my bachelor thesis called Syntactic analysis and type
evaluation in Haskell. The future goal is to create a stepwise interpreter
which can be used for teaching purposes.

Tested with GHC 6.6 and 6.10.1. Code depends on Language.Haskell library
(package libghc6-haskell-src-dev on Debian Linux; haskell-src otherwise).
Just type "make" to the command line and the binary file "hasky" should
be compiled. The directory "tests" is intended for user scripts.

Known bugs: older versions of GHC (prior to 6.6.1) are not able to parse
the foreign function definitions (the FFI library) so that parse errors
can come along. GHC 6.8.1 or newer is recommended.

The type-checker is able to parse just some basic expressions like infix
functions (and the type-checking is sometimes wrong anyway). Also, it
fails and exit the application instead of printing message.
